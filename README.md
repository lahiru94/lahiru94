### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lahiru

Iâ€™m an engineer and a leader who builds and manages engineering teams that solve real problems with clean, scalable software. I co-founded Avantrio, where we help businesses streamline operations with open-source tech.

Youâ€™ll mostly find me working with Python, Javascript, React, and Odooâ€”whatever gets the job done. I keep things pragmatic, maintainable, and no-nonsense.

If youâ€™re into building great software without the unnecessary fluff, weâ€™ll probably get along. ðŸš€
